This tutorial teaches us how to add alerts.
First things first link your html file to your console file ( for this tutorial it isconsole.js)

Then in your console file type:
alert('Your alert here')

Then when you run your html file it should have a pop-up dialog-box on the top of your screen saying
whatever is in the quotation marks of your code.
