Based on the web css is:
CSS
Programming language
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript

 I just used css to customize my button (will cover that in a later tutorial)
 I also used it to change the color and font of my text.

 For css you must always use 
 <link rel="slysheet" type="text/css" href="your-css-file.css">
 to link your file.

 And to edit your text,image or any form of data on your site,
 on the css file you put the class of the data your putting on your site.
 with a dot (period) before it and then at the end curly brackets.
 in those curly brackets you type up some css code.

        Example:
            .MyClassName {
                color: red;
                font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
            }
That is how it is set out.
