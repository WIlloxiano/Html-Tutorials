In this tutorial We learnt how to add download buttons or softwares, and images.
The same method can be applied to other file types.

The languages used in this tutorial are:
  Css (.css)
  Html (.Html)

You might be asking whats the java (.js) file for then?
Well thats just the console.
That was covered in a past tutorial

So I used the "a" attribute. (type a then press tab in an html file.)
Then in the quotation marks of href (Hyperlink reference) i typed the location of the file I want to be downloaded.
Then add some text between:
<a href=Your file location>Type some text here</a>
Then you can give the button a class and put some css on it.
Then AFTER the href quotation marks type:
download=""
Then what you type in the quotation marks should contain the name of your file and the file type (File extension)
