For website text you use:
<p>Put text here</p>
    and
<h1>Put text here</h1>

The attribute "h1" will giver larger sized text.
The attribute "p" is used for paragraphs or just for smaller font text.

TO add text you can acutally just type whatever you want in the html file in the body section
I reccomend not doing that it can mess up your file.

Remember to run the html file in your browser for this to work.
