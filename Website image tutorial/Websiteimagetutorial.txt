In This tutorial we learn how to add images to our html file.

You may not like how the image came out in this file. 
In later tutorials we will learn how to customize how this image looks with code.

(In the your own html file)
Type
"img" then press tab
and you should get this line of code:
"<img src="" alt="">"
"src" means the link or path to the image.
"alt" is the text shown if the image does not load, or image viewing is 
disabled on the site.
